## Static project to study and practice the flow of properties and states of components.

Application developed for module 04 of the GoStak bootcamp, promoted by [Rocketseat](http://www.rocketseat.com.br).

In the project, I created the application from scratch, without any tool for that, I configured the webpack, the dev and build scripts.

I create components using both functions and classes.

I imported css and media files (jpg, png and svg) both in the css files, both directly into the component.

I also used the initial concepts of application state, component properties, and component lifecycle.

## How to use

```sh
npm install
```
```sh
npm start
```
The project will run in
```sh
http://localhost:8080/
```
